The rule of thumb is don't build it if someone else already has because maintaining the code and fixing bugs is something that other developers (i.e., the open-source community) can spend their time on, and you don't have to. But if an open-source solution doesn't exist for a solution you need, you'll need to build it or try an alternative solution.\n",
